   <h3>Official BitLotto Affiliate</h3>
<p>
BitLotto is looking for webmasters wanting to earn BTC being an "Official BitLotto Affiliate" OBA
<br><br>
Being an official BitLotto affiliate is a program where BitLotto provides your site a unique BitLotto address each month that you display
on your website. The BitLotto draw will comprise of multiple published addresses. Each affiliate
will get their own address that people can use to buy tickets. Access for spending the BTC for each
address will still remain in the control of BitLotto.   
<br><br>
Why you may want to join:<br>
<ul>
<li>You get to keep the 1% of tickets purchased with your address that BitLotto would have normally kept.</li> 
<li>Very little work. All that needs to be changed each month is the address and date of the draw on your website.</li> 
<li>BitLotto does all the calculations, finds the winner, and will send 1% of tickets sold to your personal address.</li>
<li>As BitLotto grows, so does your potential profits! You keep the profits of your promotional efforts.</li>
<li>All official affilitates will be listed on the BitLotto.com website driving traffic to your website.</li>
<li>You can customize the look to fit your website integrating it however you see fit.</li>
<li>BitLotto.com will provide a simple webpage that can be used for inserting live jackpot size and 
latest address/date into your website.</li>
</ul><br><br> 
This program will help BitLotto become decentralized in true Bitcoin spirit. Tickets will then come from
multiples sources!   
<br><br>
We can not at this time accept everyone with a website! It would be way too much work at the moment.
If we don't accept you as an affiliate don't take it as we don't like your service! Our focus for
now is the more popular gambling bitcoin sites. As time goes on we'll add more and more affiliates!  
<br><br>
To be an official affiliate there are a few ground rules:
<br><br>
(NOTE: We are techies not lawyers, so we may have missed something. Essentially it boils down to:
don't trick people or be dishonest and inform your users properly. If there are valid complaints
that you don't want to fix we will no longer provide you addresses for future draws.)
<br><br>
 
a)<br>
These 5 items have to be lised on your website somehow instructing people how to play:
<br><br>
1. Send a lump sum payment of 0.25 BTC per ticket to: 1yourownaddress (Verify)<br>
2. DO NOT send BTC with an EWALLET (Link to EWALLET wiki). Use Bitcoin software running on your computer/electronic device. Exceptions:
blockchain.info and Strongcoin. <br>
3. Payment has to be verified in a block before (INSERT DRAW DATE HERE) 00:00 UTC!<br>
4. Backup your wallet. Winning funds are automatically sent to the Bitcoin wallet that sent the payment.<br>
5. Full details at: bitlotto.com 

<br><br>
b)<br>
Clicking "Verify" has to show the verify code for your address:
<br><br>
Example:<br>

c)<br>
Somehow, your website needs to remove the old address on the draw date or anytime
prior.
<br>
This will prevent people from sending BTC to BitLotto addresses for draws that are 
already over. We understand that people can get busy and we understand
that sometimes it can take time to update a website! We suggest that
if you think you'll be busy to add some php code or something that will
remove/update the address once the date has passed. 
<br><br>
For webmasters these pages will be set up for automatically updating your site:
<br>
<ul>
<li>bitlotto.com/date.php -outputs the next draw date as text (eg. "April 4")</li>
<li>bitlotto.com/jackpot.php  -outputs one number giving the current jackpot size for
inserting into your website. Please don't request too many times but cache the results
for a while to save our bandwidth.</li> 
<li>bitlotto.com/pgp-yoursite.txt -will output the "verify" text. Use this to also figure
out what address you are to use for payments. Note that you will need
to cache/save this text. At about one week before next months draw the new "verify" text will
appear. If you don't cache the text it will show the next months draw address and not the one
the user is trying to verify for that one week!</li>
</ul>
