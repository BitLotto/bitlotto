This repository holds the static html pages from http://BitLotto.com.

The purpose of this is to have an independant archive of the
site since the information on the site is used to for financial
transactions which need to be verified at a later time.

An external service, ChangeDetection.com is used to monitor for changes
to the pages which have this financial information.
When a change is detected (checked once daily) an alert is sent to 
the administrator of this archive via e-mail.

The following pages are monitored for changes:
 - http://bitlotto.com/
 - http://bitlotto.com/addresses.html
 - http://bitlotto.com/details.html
 - http://bitlotto.com/valid.html

After being alerted, the administrator pulls the site (using wget -r )
and commits the site to the repository.
